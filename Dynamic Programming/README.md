# Dynamic Programming
***Those who forget the past, 
are condemned to repeat it
	-DP***

**Understanding *Recursion* is a must**

## How to know if the problem can be solved by DP?
1. Overlapping subproblems 
2. You can find answer of bigger problem by finding and optimizing the answer of its smaller problem. 

## Steps to solve DP questions
1. Top Down (Recursion + Memoization)
2. Bottom Up (Tabulation)
3. Space optimization

The steps to follow will be **either 1. or 2. then 3.**

## Questions to be solved
